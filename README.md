# Shop list

This is a small example as use [Webtask](https://webtask.io/) with Node.js to create a serveless.
This service wait messages to create a `shopping list` in a MongoDB document which can be used by other apps.

This serveless can have integration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/discover) and Telegram trigger which will send the messages.
